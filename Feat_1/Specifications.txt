Reactor requirement

2 - Pu vector

    - Reference Pu
        => Pu from ...
    - Vector Pu #1
        => Pu from ...
    - Vector Pu #2
        => Pu from PWR UOX - High BU (High U5) and High Cooling time ( => Pu9 + Pu1 small)

3 - Reference calculation

4 - Output #2

Etcâ€¦

5 - Extension in fuel cycle simulation

    In order to have the impact at the fleet scale
