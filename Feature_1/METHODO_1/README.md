# Methodology 1 : Design Of Experiment and Massive Runs

The Pu space is defined in the specification table.

N simulations are run on the hyperspace with FCC based on a FLM method.
Output : 
- N Pu fraction at beginning of cycle
- N outputs vectors 

The FF value is determined as an average of the fractions calculated in FLM approach. This produce a reference fraction representative of the isotopic space. 

N simulation on the hyperspace are run with FCC based on FF method.
Output : 
- 1 Pu fraction
- N outputs

Final Output : 
Distributions representative of comparison factors between FLM and FF approaches.
