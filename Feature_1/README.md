In this part, the feature **Update the fuel composition vs. Fixed Fraction** is assessed. Specifications details are low in order to let a high degree of freedom in the solving. 

0. FCC requirements

For running this exercise, the FCC should have a Fuel Loading Model ([FLM](##aaa)) 


1. Reactor design and fuel

Given the different tools, methods, and specialization of each institution, it will not be possible for every institution to model the same reactor exactly the same way and fairly compare results across different codes (this would be a code-to-code comparison, which is not the purpose of the FIT Benchmarks). This is why we will allow each participant to model the specific reactor/fuel design(s) with which they are more familiar and for which they may already have models, as long as they fit the general guideline (specification) that one of these models is for a fast spectrum (e.g., metallic fuel in SFR) and another one is for a thermal spectrum (e.g., MOX fuel in PWR).

2. Facilities 

For this exercise, following facilities are required : 

- A fissile stock with a plutonium vector
- A fertile stock with a depleted uranium vector
- A fabrication plant
- A reactor
- a storage for the spent fuel

The scheme of the scenario is as following :

3. Time frame

The simulation has to be run on a full reactor cycle duration. The relation between the fuel cycle time Dt, the reactor power Pth, heavy nuclide mass M and the burn-up BU is then given by : 

BU = Pth x Dt / M

At t = 0, the fabrication plant build the fresh fuel according to reactor requirements. The fabrication time is zero and the reactor is loaded instantaneously. A complete fuel cycle is run and the spent fuel is sent to storage when the required BU is reached.

4. Plutonium vector range

The plutonium vectors that could be tested in the framework of this exercise have to be "realistic". We propose the following table with minimum and maximum isotopic fraction and total fraction in the fuel. 

| Isotope   | Min. Fraction |  Max. Fraction |
|-----------|:-------------:|---------------:|
| Pu / Fuel |               |                |
|-----------|:-------------:|---------------:|
| Pu-238    |               |                |
| Pu-239    |               |                |
| Pu-240    |               |                |
| Pu-241    |               |                |
| Pu-242    |               |                |
| Am-241    |               |                |
|-----------|:-------------:|---------------:|

Each user can use plutonium vector as long as it is included inside this range.

1. Reference calculation from RPC run 

The participant/institution (e.g., Hawaii National Laboratory) needs a reference model of the reactor (e.g., 1000 MWt metallic fuel SFR with 1.2 breeding ratio) and its fuel compositions (loaded and discharged) during the equilibrium cycle. This should be generated by an RPC (e.g., ERANOS). Let’s say the Pu content of this reference loaded fuel composition is 10 wt% and the discharged Pu content is 12 wt% (this is a breeder reactor; these are mass-weighted values across driver fuel and blankets). These are the reference values for the equilibrium SFR core using the equilibrium SFR Pu vectors in the recycled fresh fuel.

For this part, each participant/institution have to precisely describe criteria that drives the reactor calculation. For instance, it could be reactivity based for a PWR or a targeted breeding ratio for a SFR modelization. **The reference calculation is freely designed** by each participant/institution so that it can be run easily.

2. Reference calculation from FCC run

For the FCC (e.g., ORION) calculation of this reference model, this data should be easy inputs to the code. This is what we should be calling the “recipe approach”. There is no need to turn on any functionality that updates the fuel composition because the charge and discharge compositions are already provided as recipes.

For this part, each participant/institution have then to ensure that **the FCC calculation exactly fits the RPC calculation**. 

After this step, we consider that the FCC is tuned to produce the same result whatever the feature is.

3. Process tested compositions from FCC and RPC run

Now we switch the fresh fuel composition to be built from the tested isotopic vector which are specified in the specifications, so that all participants use the same Pu vector(s) in the perturbed calculations. Then, Hawaii National Laboratory needs to produce the new loaded and discharged Pu contents using the same RPC (ERANOS) and the functionality within their FCC (e.g., ORION) that they are using (e.g., Pu equivalence model with weight factors, neural network, etc.) to produce the following figure:

4. Deviation impact on a 100 years time range FCC calculation

Finally, a FCC long term calculation (up to 100 years) is done in order to have a connexion between results and « real scientific question ».
