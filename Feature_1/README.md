For each tested features, the FIT benchmark is based on a set of RPC and FCC calculations. The roadmap is presented from the first tested feature : 
    
    Update the fuel composition vs. Fixed Fraction

1. Reference calculation from RPC run 

The participant/institution (e.g., Hawaii National Laboratory) needs a reference model of the reactor (e.g., 1000 MWt metallic fuel SFR with 1.2 breeding ratio) and its fuel compositions (loaded and discharged) during the equilibrium cycle. This should be generated by an RPC (e.g., ERANOS). Let’s say the Pu content of this reference loaded fuel composition is 10 wt% and the discharged Pu content is 12 wt% (this is a breeder reactor; these are mass-weighted values across driver fuel and blankets). These are the reference values for the equilibrium SFR core using the equilibrium SFR Pu vectors in the recycled fresh fuel.

For this part, each participant/institution have to precisely describe criteria that drives the reactor calculation. For instance, it could be reactivity based for a PWR or a targeted breeding ratio for a SFR modelization. **The reference calculation is freely designed** by each participant/institution so that it can be run easily.

2. Reference calculation from FCC run

For the FCC (e.g., ORION) calculation of this reference model, this data should be easy inputs to the code. This is what we should be calling the “recipe approach”. There is no need to turn on any functionality that updates the fuel composition because the charge and discharge compositions are already provided as recipes.

For this part, each participant/institution have then to ensure that **the FCC calculation exactly fits the RPC calculation**. 

After this step, we consider that the FCC is tuned to produce the same result whatever the feature is.

3. Process tested compositions from FCC and RPC run

Now we switch the fresh fuel composition to be built from the tested isotopic vector which are specified in the specifications, so that all participants use the same Pu vector(s) in the perturbed calculations. Then, Hawaii National Laboratory needs to produce the new loaded and discharged Pu contents using the same RPC (ERANOS) and the functionality within their FCC (e.g., ORION) that they are using (e.g., Pu equivalence model with weight factors, neural network, etc.) to produce the following figure:

4. Deviation impact on a 100 years time range FCC calculation

Finally, a FCC long term calculation (up to 100 years) is done in order to have a connexion between results and « real scientific question ».   



Nomenclature has three informations : 

- The tested feature number Feat_I
- The exercise number Ex_J
- The case number Case_K

Example : Feat1_Ex1_Case1

This will define the tree in the FIT repository.

Feat_1

The scheme of the scenario is as following :

The first exercice is related to a PWR loaded with MOX fuel.

Ex2

The first exercice is related to a SFR loaded with MOX fuel.
