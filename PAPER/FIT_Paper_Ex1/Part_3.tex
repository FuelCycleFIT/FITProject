\section{Exercise definition}

\subsection{Philosophy}

Fuel fabrication models can impacts fuel cycle simulation in different ways.
This exercise aims to understand some of their impacts on an overall fuel cycle
calculation. Change in the plutonium content in a newly built MOX fuel will
impacts the fuel cycle in 3 majors ways:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the global amount of plutonium in the simulation, variation in the
        plutonium content in the MOX fuel, might lead in a increase of the
        amount of plutonium burnt in the PWR reactor, or a change in the
        breeding/burning ratio in a SFR reactor, impacting the overall amount of
        plutonium in the simulation.
    \item the location of the plutonium, indeed the amount of plutonium in the
        MOX fuel will shift the localisation of the plutonium form the front-end
        the back-end of the cycle, which could change its availability for
        other use (deployment of new reactor, fabrication of other fuels\ldots),
    \item the variation of the global amount of plutonium relative to the amount
        loaded in the fuel, the breeding/burning ratio of the plutonium will
        change the amount of plutonium in reactor.
\end{itemize}

This might not be exhaustive list of fuel fabrication models impact on a fuel
cycle, but this work will only focus on them and will not consider potential
consequence on the fuel composition change after depletion due to
over/under-estimate the amount of plutonium in the MOX fuel.

In order to investigate those impacts across multiple fuel cycle simulation
tool and associated models, the following experience has been designed.

\subsection{Methodology}

Moreover, even if the author understand that an well under-estimate plutonium
content in the MOX fuel, may compromise the reactor well operation, it is
assumed in the following that all fuel loading models used (fixed fraction or
more complex fuel loaded models), will produced proper MOX fuels.
