Since the 1990's, many different nuclear fuel cycle simulators have been
developed by several institutions.

A fuel cycle simulator aims to model an entire fleet of nuclear 
facilities such as nuclear reactors, fuel fabrication plants, reprocessing
plants, cooling pools, and waste repositories. These tools help to identify drivers
and interactions between parameters in the fuel cycle. They implement physics models
for key points in the cycle such as fuel enrichment, fabrication, and
depletions, with various levels of complexity. 

Fuel cycle simulators are used worldwide for wide range of applications:
optimizing industrial operation of an existing nuclear fleet, assessing
the future of nuclear energy, providing valuable information to political 
decision-makers, and evaluating/verifying the operation of an existing
nuclear fleet by national or international safety authorities. Moreover, these
tools are used for Research and Development training as access point to key
data related to the fuel cycle.

The myriad institutions that develop and use fuel cycle simulators pursue myriad
goals. Consequently, software development decisions (e.g. fidelity) are often 
made in accordance with the institution's simulation goals. To improve
confidence in the results, institutions may be tempted to increase the complexity
of their software even if this complexity might not be necessary.

As an example, neutron and gamma dose calculations require the precise
knowledge of each material isotopic composition in each facility whereas a
uranium consumption calculation does not require the same degree of detail. As a
consequence, some software functionality may not be necessary regarding the
technical question the code assesses: solving a given technical question
associated with a targeted precision will required a limited set of
functionality. Knowing the importance of each will help users choose an
appropriate software tool or may guide future code development to solve a specific
question. Also, some technical issues are assessed by numerous studies performed
with different software and it is often difficult to compare them. Knowing the
impact of functionalities on different simulation outputs helps to estimate the
level of confidence of the different fuel cycle studies.

The FIT (Functionality Isolation Test) Project has been conceived to understand
the circumstances under which the choice of algorithm and/or model influences
the conclusions that one might draw from such a fuel cycle simulation. The
project aims to determine the minimum level of details in fuel cycle simulations
required as a function of the study and the wanted confidence level. Among
different functionality of interest, this first work focuses on the ability of
fuel cycle software to build fresh fuel regarding to the available material for
fuel fabrication and the reactors requirements.

The first part of the paper describes the FIT project, its philosophy and the
participants and associated simulators. It explains why the FIT project is not a
traditional benchmark and does not aim to do inter-simulator comparison, but
focuses on intra-simulators comparison, evaluating differences between
simulation results, produced by the same simulator, enabling and disabling  the
features to test. In order to build confidence in the conclusion, such
comparison will be done across multiple simulators. This part ends with the
description of the particular feature tested in this work which is the fuel
loading management. The second part presents the design of experiment used to
test this particular feature: input simulation descriptions, technical
specificities and finally output metrics used to quantify the impact of the use
of fuel loading management in fuel cycle studies are detailed. Finally, the
third part is dedicated to the different results of each software involved in
this first exercise and some conclusion are withdrawn.
