Since the 1990's, many different fuel cycle dynamic simulator code have been developed by several institutions for different purposes.

Fuel cycle tools are used to study current nuclear fleet for industrial operation optimization. The future of nuclear energy could also be assesed by those simulators and provide informations for political decision process. Finally, those tools are used for Research and Development training. As they model an entire nuclear fleet with nuclear reactors, fuel fabrication plants, reprocessing plants, cooling pool and waste disposal among others, they help identify drivers and interactions between parameters in fuel cycle physic. For that, they often implement physic models for different key points of the cycle like fuel fabrication or burn up depletion calculations for instance.

The different institutions that use fuel cycle simulations pursue different goals. Consequently, their computational tools vary in term of complexity, from a spreadsheet to a complex simulation code framework. The level of complexity of each software has to be coherent in regards to the different studies it is used for. To improve confidence in the results, institutions are tempted to increase the complexity of their software even if this complexity might not be necessary.

As an example, the neutron and gamma doses calculation requires the precise knowledge of each material isotopic composition in each facilities whereas uranium consumption calculation does not require this degree of detail. As a consequence, some software features may not be necessary regarding the technical question the code assesses. Yet, developing a new feature is time consuming. Actually, to solve a given technical question associated to a targeted precision, some features are needed and others are not. Knowing the importance of each ones helps to choose an appropriate software or to engage code developments to solve the question. On the other side, some technical issues are assessed by numerous studies performed with different software and it is often difficult to compare them. Knowing the impact of features on different simulation outputs helps to estimate the confidence level of studies.

The FIT project (for Functionality Isolation Test) has been conceived for this purpose. According to the type of study and the wanted confidence level, what should be the level of details in fuel cycle simulations that has to be taken into account? Among different features of interest, this first work focuses on the ability of fuel cycle software to adapt the fresh fuel composition regarding to the available material for fuel fabrication.

The first part of the paper describes the FIT project, its philosophy and the participant with their own software. It explains how each code is used with and without the feature to test in order to quantify its impact on fuel cycle observables and why this is not a traditional benchmark. This part ends by the description of the particular feature tested in this work which is the fuel loading management. The second part presents the design of experiment used to test this particular feature: input simulation descriptions, technical specificities and finally output metrics used to quantify the impact of the use of fuel loading management in fuel cycle studies are detailed. Finally, the third part is dedicated to the different results of each software involved in this first exercise and some conclusion are withdrawn.
