Since the 1990's, many different nuclear fuel cycle simulation codes have been
developed by several institutions.

A fuel cycle code aims to models an entire nuclear fleet including main
facilities, like nuclear reactors, fuel fabrication plants, reprocessing plants,
cooling pool and waste disposal. Those tools help to identify drivers and
interactions between parameters in fuel cycle physic. For that, they often
implement physic models for different key points of the cycle like fuel
fabrication or burn up depletion calculations. 

Fuel cycle simulation codes are used worldwide for different purposes. Fuel
cycle tools can be used to study current nuclear fleet for industrial operation
optimization. Those tools can also be used to assess the future of nuclear
energy and provide then informations for political decision process. Finally,
those tools may be used for Research and Development training as they give an
access to key point data related to the fuel cycle. 

The different institutions that use fuel cycle simulations pursue different
goals. Consequently, their computational tools vary in term of complexity. The
level of complexity of each software has to be coherent in regards to the
different studies it is used for. To improve confidence in the results,
institutions are tempted to increase the complexity of their software even if
this complexity might not be necessary.

As an example, the neutron and gamma doses calculation requires the precise
knowledge of each material isotopic composition in each facilities whereas
uranium consumption calculation does not require this degree of detail. As a
consequence, some software functionality may not be necessary regarding the
technical question the code assesses. In other words, to solve a given technical
question associated to a targeted precision, some functionality are needed while
some others are not. Knowing the importance of each ones helps to choose an
appropriate software or to engage code developments to solve the question. Also,
some technical issues are assessed by numerous studies performed with different
software and it is often difficult to compare them. Knowing the impact of
functionality on different simulation outputs helps to estimate the confidence
level of studies.

The FIT (Functionality Isolation Test) Project has been conceived for this
purpose. The project goal is to determine the minimum level of details in fuel
cycle simulations that has to be taken into account according to the type of
study and the wanted confidence level. Among different functionality of
interest, this first work focuses on the ability of fuel cycle software to adapt
the fresh fuel composition regarding to the available material for fuel
fabrication.

The first part of the paper describes the FIT project, its philosophy and the
participant with their own software. It explains how each code is used with and
without the feature to test in order to quantify its impact on fuel cycle
observables and why this is not a traditional benchmark. This part ends by the
description of the particular feature tested in this work which is the fuel
loading management. The second part presents the design of experiment used to
test this particular feature: input simulation descriptions, technical
specificities and finally output metrics used to quantify the impact of the use
of fuel loading management in fuel cycle studies are detailed. Finally, the
third part is dedicated to the different results of each software involved in
this first exercise and some conclusion are withdrawn.
